* feat: Migrate SSL/reverse proxy from Traefik to Caddy, updating deployment configurations and removing old authentication files. ([`ca04204`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/ca0420403bdd6056a660b5186f2d76608a453a95))

* feat(security): prevent log injection by sanitizing untrusted inputs

Introduced a `sanitize_for_log` utility to escape non-printable characters in log messages.
Applied sanitization to:
- MQTT payloads and topics in `src/mqtt_client.py`
- Call signs, endpoint types, and API responses in `src/caltopo_reporter.py`
- Node info, telemetry, and traceroute data in `src/gateway_app.py`

This mitigates CWE-117 (Improper Output Neutralization for Logs).

Added `tests/test_utils.py` to verify sanitization logic. ([`3c98ba9`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/3c98ba914de2a81f189a7f9ea95d3a3699876aa0))

* Fixes issues from PR review

This commit addresses three issues identified in the pull request review:

- Adds whitespace validation to the `CalTopoConfig` Pydantic model to strip leading and trailing whitespace from the `connect_key` and `group` fields.
- Adds a `close()` method to the `GatewayApp` class to explicitly close the `SqliteDict` database connections on application shutdown.
- Updates the `scripts/setup_wizard.py` script to use the correct keys (`broker` and `username`) for the MQTT configuration and to handle multiple users. ([`55f0b3a`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/55f0b3a743ae75e925917ce7373e61021c0e0075))

* Add engineering review document for Meshtopo Gateway

- Introduced a comprehensive engineering review and modernization roadmap for the Meshtopo Gateway project.
- The document outlines strategic recommendations for improving user onboarding, enhancing architectural resilience, and modernizing the codebase.
- Key initiatives include unifying configuration processes, implementing an interactive setup wizard, transitioning to an asynchronous core, and fortifying dependency management. ([`9e9cca3`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/9e9cca325d67b7fffe27ae686e4dfdd0b2470bf3))

* Fix: Correct print statement formatting in Mosquitto configuration script

- Combined two lines of a print statement into a single line for improved clarity when instructing users on starting the MQTT broker. ([`7edcf10`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/7edcf10e6922aa92160a14b8a32145e57710a2d2))

* Fix: Update Mosquitto configuration generation script for improved clarity

- Added a comment to suppress linting warning in the generate_mosquitto_config.py script.
- Split a long print statement into two lines for better readability when informing users about starting the MQTT broker. ([`fa0ca2e`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/fa0ca2eb66707b9dd9a361481cd0c9322e4332df))

* Update README and configuration files for improved clarity and functionality

- Enhanced the README.md for better formatting and readability of features and configuration instructions.
- Updated docker-compose.yml to correct volume paths for configuration files.
- Modified mosquitto.conf to ensure a single global password_file directive and adjusted max_packet_size for better performance.
- Improved the mosquitto configuration generation script to utilize mosquitto_passwd for password management, ensuring compatibility with Mosquitto 2.0.
- Added troubleshooting notes for common MQTT broker issues in the README. ([`0ce42b0`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/0ce42b0b87496be131eeb570ed8ca087fba0ea25))

Harden caltopo reporter ([`c28ceef`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/c28ceefcbba42261f3c5728e5472858e4308bcec))

* Refactor: Improve readability of URL construction in CalTopoReporter

This commit enhances the readability of the URL construction in the CalTopoReporter class by formatting multi-line strings for better clarity. The changes include:

- Adjusted the logging of the connect_key URL to use a more readable format.
- Simplified the construction of test URLs for both connect_key and group identifiers.

These modifications aim to improve code maintainability and readability without altering functionality. ([`1baeef8`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/1baeef88f77f0b355607af9b32ad1f614185f644))

* Fix: Harden CalTopo reporter against URL injection and log exposure

This commit introduces two security enhancements to the CalTopo reporter:

1.  **Identifier Validation:** The `connect_key` and `group` identifiers are now validated to ensure they only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores. This prevents potential URL manipulation vulnerabilities.

2.  **Log Redaction:** The `connect_key` is now redacted from the URL in log messages to prevent sensitive information from being exposed in logs. ([`b7d22e8`](https://github.com/clayauld/meshtopo/commit/b7d22e88230dba263e593cedba6019390d8ec4d2))
